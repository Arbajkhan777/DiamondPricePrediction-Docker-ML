# DiamondPricePrediction-Docker-ML

## 🔥Project Overview
DiamondPricePrediction-Docker-ML is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the prices of diamonds based on various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and more. This project uses Docker for containerization.

## 📄Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Predicts diamond prices using advanced regression techniques.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent and reproducible environments.
- **MLflow**: Tracks experiments, logs parameters and metrics, and manages models.

## 🛠️Technologies Used
- Python
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Docker
- MLflow
- Flask
